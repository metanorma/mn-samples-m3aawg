<semantic__title>Foreword</semantic__title>
<semantic__p id="semantic___014a8b6b-2e2b-7f87-2788-7329d131dfb4">M3AAWG, the Messaging, Malware and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group, appreciates
this opportunity to comment on the Initial Report of the Temporary Specification
for gTLD Registration Data Phase 2 Expedited Policy Development Process
(<semantic__link target="https://gnso.icann.org/en/issues/epdp-phase-2-initial-07feb20-en.pdf"/>). We make these
comments in our capacities as cybersecurity professionals and researchers committed
to ensuring the security and stability of the internet, including the domain name
ecosystem.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___6a01d67f-f1a1-1f0a-f3fa-1c4938a5cb51">This issue is very important to M3AAWG members.
<semantic__strong>Our 2018 Joint Survey published jointly with the Anti-Phishing Working Group</semantic__strong>
found that changes to WHOIS access
following ICANN’s implementation of the Temporary Specification is significantly
impeding cyber applications and forensic investigations and allowing more harm to
victims. M3AAWG appreciates the hard work of the EPDP Phase 2 team and the
progress they have made to date. The successful completion of this policy and the
ultimate implementation of a workable System for Standardized Access/Disclosure
(SSAD) of Registration Data is key to organizations and individuals, including many of
our members, that require access to registration data in order to detect threats,
investigate new attack vectors and to understand trends aimed at protecting users and
the Internet as a whole. This includes law enforcement authorities, both civil and
criminal, who rely on the analysis and coloration of Registration Data obtained by
private sector researchers and security. Failure to allow these professionals to access
this data will threaten the security, stability and resiliency of the Internet as a whole and
result in higher abuse rates, more harm inflicted on users and result in more criminal
impunity on a global scale.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___4a505fb4-db33-0e4a-a010-d71b68eb09c5">Given that context, M3AAWG has identified the following preliminary recommendations
that represent the greatest concern to our members.</semantic__p>
</semantic__foreword></semantic__preface><semantic__sections>
<semantic__clause id="semantic___preliminary_recommendation_12_query_policy" obligation="normative">
<semantic__title>Preliminary Recommendation #12. Query Policy</semantic__title>
<semantic__p id="semantic___1d7dea3d-29fd-614f-254f-88b93a700369">In the course of investigations, especially those of a global nature, it is often necessary
to request many thousands of requests for Registration data from the SSAD system.
While we appreciate the need for any system to protect itself from abuse of all kinds, we
are concerned that the definition of “abusive use” of the SSAD, specifically point #4,
may inadvertently interfere with some investigations. E.g</semantic__p>

<semantic__quote id="semantic___d246f23e-05fe-c95b-74e5-688398813c24"><semantic__p id="semantic___0147f57a-b51a-14be-513a-ec3d14886e83">‌4. Storing/delaying and sending high-volume requests causing the SSAD or
other parties to fail SLA performance. When investigating abuse based on
this specific behavior, the concept of proportionality should be considered.</semantic__p>
</semantic__quote>

<semantic__p id="semantic___7d960a16-c16e-66c5-72f8-3468bef2a7d4">Query policy limits enforced by the SSAD must not impede the access required by
accredited investigators to detect, attribute and mitigate abuse on a global scale. The
receipt of requests at this scale must not result in throttling or result in a situation where
legitimate requests are rejected.</semantic__p>
</semantic__clause>

<semantic__clause id="semantic___preliminary_recommendation_9_determining_variable_slas_for_response_times_for_ssad" obligation="normative">
<semantic__title>Preliminary Recommendation #9. Determining Variable SLAs for response times for SSAD</semantic__title>
<semantic__p id="semantic___ade0afc1-db41-fb6e-faca-2164572f8415">The definition and enforcement of SLA associated with response times is of high
importance to ensuring a workable and effective SSAD system. We note that the ability
of accredited cyber-security investigators to tag their requests as “Urgent Requests” is
currently not possible given the current definition. At best it is unclear:</semantic__p>

<semantic__quote id="semantic___1c4a0689-c66b-c9c6-0984-74fb05eff368"><semantic__p id="semantic___e5a2a557-98c9-e2a6-3265-94fdb9743662">“The criteria to determine whether it concerns an urgent request are limited to circumstances that pose an imminent threat to life, serious bodily injury, critical infrastructure (online and offline) or child exploitation.”</semantic__p>
</semantic__quote>

<semantic__p id="semantic___55d2f5a2-4367-d185-252a-6c16e6669baf">Given most campaigns to attack internet users [consumers] are short lived by design, a
maximum response time of 5 business days is neither acceptable nor sufficient. By
then the damage will have been done. As such the definition of “Urgent Requests”
must be updated to include the important work of cybersecurity investigators.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___3ad3ebff-0f91-f7a2-fbad-458e6a0a65ea">We suggest adding the following language to make it clear that accredited cybersecurity
researchers can submit requests that have been tagged as Urgent.</semantic__p>

<semantic__quote id="semantic___4f0a893f-c562-16eb-5190-51c9be452d09"><semantic__p id="semantic___24d8a347-1f7c-69e8-795c-113784612b4c">“For the avoidance of doubt, this includes issues related to malware, Botnets [and their command and control systems], phishing, pharming and abuse related to consumer fraud.”</semantic__p>
</semantic__quote>

<semantic__p id="semantic___6375894a-8a5a-1342-23ba-9f94548d4086">Finally, we note that the SLAs defined in Recommendation #9 focus on response times
only. In order to ensure transparency of the system in addition to allowing
accountability to the community there must exist a mechanism to measure the rate of
disclosure of RDS data across all disclosers. As such an SLA that measures and tracks
disclosure rates must be added to this recommendation. The data associated with this
SLA must be routinely audited and reported publicly.</semantic__p>
</semantic__clause>

<semantic__clause id="semantic___preliminary_recommendation_7_authorization_for_automated_disclosure_requests" obligation="normative">
<semantic__title>Preliminary Recommendation #7. Authorization for automated disclosure requests</semantic__title>
<semantic__p id="semantic___542acf84-0dfc-0dc8-461f-62f496d9f3a9">In order to be effective, the SSAD system (as defined in the initial report) must support
additional use cases that can be fully automated above and beyond the two currently
specified (in Jurisdiction LEA and URS/UDRP due process). These must include use
cases related to the needs of properly Accredited cybersecurity and anti-abuse
investigators.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___3c3d7620-3f18-3ba5-a18f-66ad6f5f1c1f">We note that additional use case review will be the subject of further discussion by the
EPDP Phase 2 working group. In our review of the “Working Draft Use Case Candidates for Possible Automation”<semantic__fn reference="1"><semantic__p id="semantic___f849e771-4eec-dad1-ac9d-c7dc88423296"><semantic__link target="https://community.icann.org/display/EOTSFGRD/Working+Draft+Use+Case+Candidates+for+Possible+Automation"/></semantic__p>
</semantic__fn>, we are encouraged that Use Case #7 “Identify infrastructure involved in botnets, malware, phishing, and consumer fraud” will be
considered and believe strongly that an SSAD system that did not include this (or a
similar) use cases would not address the needs of accredited cybersecurity and antiabuse investigators.</semantic__p>
</semantic__clause>

<semantic__clause id="semantic___preliminary_recommendation_19_mechanism_for_the_continuous_evolution_of_the_ssad" obligation="normative">
<semantic__title>Preliminary Recommendation #19. Mechanism for the continuous evolution of the SSAD</semantic__title>
<semantic__p id="semantic___e2faab32-ba66-1a14-229f-2f2f168536ee">The need for a mechanism that ensures the SSAD system can evolve at Internet speed
is a very important concept and policy must exist to support it. It is equally important
that transparency, accountability and full participation by all stakeholders be assured
and as such we insist that any mechanism involved in defining how the SSAD will
evolve include stakeholders outside of the GNSO, including the SSAC, GAC and ALAC.
In addition, decisions that result from this mechanism must not be subject to a vote from
the GNSO Council that does not include the Advisory Committees.</semantic__p>
</semantic__clause>

<semantic__clause id="semantic___preliminary_recommendation_15_financial_sustainability" obligation="normative">
<semantic__title>Preliminary Recommendation #15. Financial Sustainability</semantic__title>
<semantic__p id="semantic___581a8283-48e6-84b9-d1f1-91e1cf8c26f9">M3AAWG is very concerned that the use of the SSAD may involve per
transaction/requests charges. While we do not object to reasonable fees to ensure
proper accreditation of members of the cybersecurity community, we would object to
any financial sustainability model that may impose any per-transaction fees related to
requests required during the course of a legitimate investigations.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___d62c65de-05a3-8a9a-0674-aba04fabeb4f">Thank you in advance for your consideration of these comments.</semantic__p>

<title>Foreword</title>
<p id="_014a8b6b-2e2b-7f87-2788-7329d131dfb4">M3AAWG, the Messaging, Malware and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group, appreciates
this opportunity to comment on the Initial Report of the Temporary Specification
for gTLD Registration Data Phase 2 Expedited Policy Development Process
(<link target="https://gnso.icann.org/en/issues/epdp-phase-2-initial-07feb20-en.pdf"/>). We make these
comments in our capacities as cybersecurity professionals and researchers committed
to ensuring the security and stability of the internet, including the domain name
ecosystem.</p>

<p id="_6a01d67f-f1a1-1f0a-f3fa-1c4938a5cb51">This issue is very important to M3AAWG members.
<strong>Our 2018 Joint Survey published jointly with the Anti-Phishing Working Group</strong>
found that changes to WHOIS access
following ICANN’s implementation of the Temporary Specification is significantly
impeding cyber applications and forensic investigations and allowing more harm to
victims. M3AAWG appreciates the hard work of the EPDP Phase 2 team and the
progress they have made to date. The successful completion of this policy and the
ultimate implementation of a workable System for Standardized Access/Disclosure
(SSAD) of Registration Data is key to organizations and individuals, including many of
our members, that require access to registration data in order to detect threats,
investigate new attack vectors and to understand trends aimed at protecting users and
the Internet as a whole. This includes law enforcement authorities, both civil and
criminal, who rely on the analysis and coloration of Registration Data obtained by
private sector researchers and security. Failure to allow these professionals to access
this data will threaten the security, stability and resiliency of the Internet as a whole and
result in higher abuse rates, more harm inflicted on users and result in more criminal
impunity on a global scale.</p>

<p id="_4a505fb4-db33-0e4a-a010-d71b68eb09c5">Given that context, M3AAWG has identified the following preliminary recommendations
that represent the greatest concern to our members.</p>
</foreword></preface><sections>
<clause id="_preliminary_recommendation_12_query_policy" obligation="normative" displayorder="2">
<title depth="1">1.<tab/>Preliminary Recommendation #12. Query Policy</title>
<p id="_1d7dea3d-29fd-614f-254f-88b93a700369">In the course of investigations, especially those of a global nature, it is often necessary
to request many thousands of requests for Registration data from the SSAD system.
While we appreciate the need for any system to protect itself from abuse of all kinds, we
are concerned that the definition of “abusive use” of the SSAD, specifically point #4,
may inadvertently interfere with some investigations. E.g</p>

<quote id="_d246f23e-05fe-c95b-74e5-688398813c24"><p id="_0147f57a-b51a-14be-513a-ec3d14886e83">‌4. Storing/delaying and sending high-volume requests causing the SSAD or
other parties to fail SLA performance. When investigating abuse based on
this specific behavior, the concept of proportionality should be considered.</p>
</quote>

<p id="_7d960a16-c16e-66c5-72f8-3468bef2a7d4">Query policy limits enforced by the SSAD must not impede the access required by
accredited investigators to detect, attribute and mitigate abuse on a global scale. The
receipt of requests at this scale must not result in throttling or result in a situation where
legitimate requests are rejected.</p>
</clause>

<clause id="_preliminary_recommendation_9_determining_variable_slas_for_response_times_for_ssad" obligation="normative" displayorder="3">
<title depth="1">2.<tab/>Preliminary Recommendation #9. Determining Variable SLAs for response times for SSAD</title>
<p id="_ade0afc1-db41-fb6e-faca-2164572f8415">The definition and enforcement of SLA associated with response times is of high
importance to ensuring a workable and effective SSAD system. We note that the ability
of accredited cyber-security investigators to tag their requests as “Urgent Requests” is
currently not possible given the current definition. At best it is unclear:</p>

<quote id="_1c4a0689-c66b-c9c6-0984-74fb05eff368"><p id="_e5a2a557-98c9-e2a6-3265-94fdb9743662">“The criteria to determine whether it concerns an urgent request are limited to circumstances that pose an imminent threat to life, serious bodily injury, critical infrastructure (online and offline) or child exploitation.”</p>
</quote>

<p id="_55d2f5a2-4367-d185-252a-6c16e6669baf">Given most campaigns to attack internet users [consumers] are short lived by design, a
maximum response time of 5 business days is neither acceptable nor sufficient. By
then the damage will have been done. As such the definition of “Urgent Requests”
must be updated to include the important work of cybersecurity investigators.</p>

<p id="_3ad3ebff-0f91-f7a2-fbad-458e6a0a65ea">We suggest adding the following language to make it clear that accredited cybersecurity
researchers can submit requests that have been tagged as Urgent.</p>

<quote id="_4f0a893f-c562-16eb-5190-51c9be452d09"><p id="_24d8a347-1f7c-69e8-795c-113784612b4c">“For the avoidance of doubt, this includes issues related to malware, Botnets [and their command and control systems], phishing, pharming and abuse related to consumer fraud.”</p>
</quote>

<p id="_6375894a-8a5a-1342-23ba-9f94548d4086">Finally, we note that the SLAs defined in Recommendation #9 focus on response times
only. In order to ensure transparency of the system in addition to allowing
accountability to the community there must exist a mechanism to measure the rate of
disclosure of RDS data across all disclosers. As such an SLA that measures and tracks
disclosure rates must be added to this recommendation. The data associated with this
SLA must be routinely audited and reported publicly.</p>
</clause>

<clause id="_preliminary_recommendation_7_authorization_for_automated_disclosure_requests" obligation="normative" displayorder="4">
<title depth="1">3.<tab/>Preliminary Recommendation #7. Authorization for automated disclosure requests</title>
<p id="_542acf84-0dfc-0dc8-461f-62f496d9f3a9">In order to be effective, the SSAD system (as defined in the initial report) must support
additional use cases that can be fully automated above and beyond the two currently
specified (in Jurisdiction LEA and URS/UDRP due process). These must include use
cases related to the needs of properly Accredited cybersecurity and anti-abuse
investigators.</p>

<p id="_3c3d7620-3f18-3ba5-a18f-66ad6f5f1c1f">We note that additional use case review will be the subject of further discussion by the
EPDP Phase 2 working group. In our review of the “Working Draft Use Case Candidates for Possible Automation”<fn reference="1"><p id="_f849e771-4eec-dad1-ac9d-c7dc88423296"><link target="https://community.icann.org/display/EOTSFGRD/Working+Draft+Use+Case+Candidates+for+Possible+Automation"/></p>
</fn>, we are encouraged that Use Case #7 “Identify infrastructure involved in botnets, malware, phishing, and consumer fraud” will be
considered and believe strongly that an SSAD system that did not include this (or a
similar) use cases would not address the needs of accredited cybersecurity and antiabuse investigators.</p>
</clause>

<clause id="_preliminary_recommendation_19_mechanism_for_the_continuous_evolution_of_the_ssad" obligation="normative" displayorder="5">
<title depth="1">4.<tab/>Preliminary Recommendation #19. Mechanism for the continuous evolution of the SSAD</title>
<p id="_e2faab32-ba66-1a14-229f-2f2f168536ee">The need for a mechanism that ensures the SSAD system can evolve at Internet speed
is a very important concept and policy must exist to support it. It is equally important
that transparency, accountability and full participation by all stakeholders be assured
and as such we insist that any mechanism involved in defining how the SSAD will
evolve include stakeholders outside of the GNSO, including the SSAC, GAC and ALAC.
In addition, decisions that result from this mechanism must not be subject to a vote from
the GNSO Council that does not include the Advisory Committees.</p>
</clause>

<clause id="_preliminary_recommendation_15_financial_sustainability" obligation="normative" displayorder="6">
<title depth="1">5.<tab/>Preliminary Recommendation #15. Financial Sustainability</title>
<p id="_581a8283-48e6-84b9-d1f1-91e1cf8c26f9">M3AAWG is very concerned that the use of the SSAD may involve per
transaction/requests charges. While we do not object to reasonable fees to ensure
proper accreditation of members of the cybersecurity community, we would object to
any financial sustainability model that may impose any per-transaction fees related to
requests required during the course of a legitimate investigations.</p>

<p id="_d62c65de-05a3-8a9a-0674-aba04fabeb4f">Thank you in advance for your consideration of these comments.</p>
