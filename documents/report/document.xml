<title>Executive Summary</title>
<p id="_00da7265-5608-75b3-007b-aaab37721e11">This is the first industry report with data provided directly by service operators and ISPs detailing
the number of subscribers identified as having a system infected by malware, also known a “bot,”
and the percentage of those subscribers notified of the problem. It is the first cooperative effort by
network service providers to quantify the extent of malicious bots infecting their subscribers. The
Messaging, Malware and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group will periodically issue updated reports.</p>

<p id="_881c3499-08eb-341a-51d9-245358d31d43">Based on the data provided to M<sup>3</sup>AAWG, in 2012 participating network operators reported the
number of infected subscribers ranged from .84 % to 1.18 % with 99.13 % to 99.21 % of those
subscribers being notified they had a bot. In 2013, the number of infected subscribers varied from
1.04 % to .80 % with 99.82 % to 93.99 % of consumers being notified.</p>
</clause>

<clause id="_about_the_m3aawg_bot_metrics_program" obligation="normative">
<title>About the M<sup>3</sup>AAWG Bot Metrics Program</title>
<p id="_46b328f4-b5e9-6ef3-d87f-53e51c0586e0">These metrics are the first cooperative effort by the network companies that directly provide end-users Internet access, and thus see the data first hand, to quantify the extent of malicious bots
afflicting their subscribers. The metrics cover only end-user connections and do not include
enterprise business networks.</p>

<p id="_d1b5565c-fae5-a13b-abf5-4b9154782dcc">This is a voluntary program with data provided confidentially by ISPs and service providers. The
data is shared at the discretion of each company and is reported here as aggregated monthly metrics
summarized by quarters. While the report represents the contributions of ISPs and network
operators working within M<sup>3</sup>AAWG to address malware and bots, M<sup>3</sup>AAWG members are under
no obligation to supply this information or to participate in this program.</p>

<p id="_4d5daef3-65f0-f92f-fde8-37cb84a9d632">The M<sup>3</sup>AAWG Bot Metrics Program is an objective tool for tracking industry and government
efforts at controlling the spread of bots and we are committed to continuing this important work.
Similar to the <link target="https://www.m3aawg.org/m3aawg-reports">M<sup>3</sup>AAWG Email Metrics Report</link> on abusive messaging, we expect these reports will
become an important resource for understanding the extent of bot infections and to measuring the
effectiveness of the industry’s efforts to protect end-users.</p>
</clause>

<clause id="_observations" obligation="normative">
<title>Observations</title>
<p id="_5fc36d80-d247-ecba-dde0-aa11f606ce57">While definitions of bots can differ from country to country, the metrics below report on malware,
or malicious code, discovered by a network operator while processing a subscriber’s email or other
Internet activities. Bots are installed directly on end-users’ systems, often without their knowledge.
Once deployed, the “botted” machine can be controlled by commands from a “bot master,” a
person who uses infected machines as a network to send spam or carry out fraudulent activities. The
malicious code is often designed to run in background mode, so subscribers are usually unaware
their systems are infected.</p>

<p id="_e6ed8ff6-3af1-e9c6-3637-5c356dc8ebbc">While Internet service providers and network operators are able to identify infected users on their
networks, subscribers must remove the malware from their systems. Based on the data in this
report, network operators are notifying about 98.7 % of end-users when they are infected. This
points out the importance of the entire Internet ecosystem working together to address this
problem, including security software vendors and end users.</p>

<p id="_20d7728a-65d6-ebf5-9986-774ff2bffc2f">The statistics reported below are compiled from confidential monthly data provided by participating
M<sup>3</sup>AAWG member ISPs and network operators summarized here by quarter from 2012 through
2013. Our reporting basis covers a quarterly average of up to 43.5 million subscribers.</p>
